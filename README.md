## Abstract
&nbsp;&nbsp;Crystals are solid materials with periodic and symmetric molecular patterns. The structure
of a crystalline solid determines its properties, making it essential to study its structures.
From the principle of minimum energy, a crystal will choose a structure with the lowest free
energy _F = U â€“ TS_. At low temperatures, we can usually ignore the temperature dependent
term _TS_ and consider the internal energy as a first approximation to the free energy.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the theoretical and computational study of crystals, _ab initio_ methods are extremely
important as they do not require experimental results as inputs. Density Functional Theory
(DFT) is one of the commonly used _ab initio_ methods. DFT uses electron density to solve the
difficulties of _ab initio_ quantum mechanical calculations and reduce the required computing
power.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;In this research, we study the equilibrium structures of three different Indium alloys at
low temperatures. Indium alloys are often used for lead-free soldering, semiconductors, and
medical tools. For each alloy, two different structures are studied using a Python code
integrated with Quantum ESPRESSO (QE). By calculating the lowest energy for competing
structures, this study can identify the equilibrium structures of these three alloys at room
temperature and below.
